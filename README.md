This is a project for a family that wanted to create a family tree, and keep up with news and updates about a family reunion and other family news. 
It will have a registration page linked to a database so that when someone registers, it will automatically update the family tree. This means that
there will be some kind of security to keep the bots or anyone not welcomed out. How do we do that? Not sure. But we will find a way.
